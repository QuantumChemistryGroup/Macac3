Cartesian coordinates (in Ã…) of PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP optimized structures along with harmonic frequencies in the form of *dat files used for the calculations of the thermal correction to enthalpy HCORR with the standalone Thermochemistry program, tabulated DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DFT single-point energies, T1/t2 diagnostics values in the form of *txt files for all M(acac)3 complexes and reference species. 

Generated post-processed model reactions are presented in the form of *list files. Each *list file is accompanied with a list of reference species in the form of *tmp file.
